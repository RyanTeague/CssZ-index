    <!--CSS Layout - The z-index property
    
        The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
    -->

    <!--The z-index Property
    
        When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

        The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which
        elemnt should be placed in fornt of, or behind, the orthers).

        An element can have a positive or negative stack order:
    -->

    <!--This is a heading
    
        Becuase the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behide the text.
    -->

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <img src="img_tree.png">
    <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>

    <hr>

    <!--Note: z-index only works on postioned elements (position: absolute,
        position: relative, position: fixed, or position: stickly) and flex items
        (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).
    -->

    <!--Another z-index Example
        
        Example
        Here we see that an element with greater stack order is always above an
        element with a lower stack order
    -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="black-box">Black box</div>
        <div class="gray-box">Gray box</div>
        <div class="green-box">Green box</div>
    </div>

    <!--Without z-index
    
        If two positioned elements overlap each other without a z-index specified,
        the element defined last in the HTML code will be shown on top.

        Example
        Same example as above, but here with no z-index specified:
    -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="black-box">Black box</div>
        <div class="gray-box">Gray box</div>
        <div class="green-box">Green box</div>
    </div>

    <!--CSS Property
    
        z-index         Sets the stack order of an element
    -->
